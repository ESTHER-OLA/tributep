                                coup,
                                with the help of officers, including Joshua M. Dogonyaro and Sani Abacha.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>July 1, 1987:</strong>General Ibrahim Babangida announced a six-year transition
                                programme scheduled to begin in the third quarter of the year. The programme was aimed at
                                disengaging the military from power and introducing civilian rule in 1992. The timetable
                                included local government elections on a zero-party basis, the lifting of the ban on
                                politics and the
                                registration of political parties as well as the inauguration of elected state governments.

                                The electoral commission was headed by Professor of Political Science, Eme Ewa.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>October 12, 1987:</strong> The National Electoral Commission (NEC) commenced
                                registration of
                                voters for local government elections all over the nation.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>December 12, 1987:</strong> Nigerians voted in the first local government elections
                                of the transition programme
                                for return to civilian rule by 1992.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>October 1988:</strong> In a statement, IBB says “We have not chosen and have not
                                sought to choose those who will succeed us. We have only decided on those who will not”, the
                                first signal that he was
                                going to be directly involved in the process of electing the next democratic leader.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>May 1989: </strong>IBB declines recognition to twenty political organisations which
                                indicated interest in registering for elections, instead creates the Social
                                Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC).</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>December 1991:</strong> At the behest of a delegation which included Shehu Shagari
                                and Ibrahim Dasuki (18th Sultan of Sokoto, father of Col Sambo Dasuki and IBB’s surrogate
                                father), General Babangida lifts the ban on old breed politicians.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>August 7, 1992:</strong> SDP primaries produces Shehu Musa Yar’adua, its leader, as
                                Presidential candidate. The National Electoral Commission (NEC), however, canceled the first
                                round of presidential primaries, for alleged widespread irregularities.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>December 1992:</strong> Elections into the House of Assembly was conducted with the
                                SDP winning most of the seats.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>March 1993:</strong> Abiola stood for the presidential nomination of the Social
                                Democratic Party (SDP) and beat Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to
                                secure the presidential nomination of the SDP.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>May 1, 1993:</strong> Abiola chooses Kingibe as running mate, smiting Yar’adua.
                                There had been a previous agreement to reimburse Yar’adua’s campaign expenses to the tune of
                                15 million naira. However, the choice of his protégé, whom he saw as a betrayer, against his
                                choice of Atiku Abubakar, created an irreconcilable fissure between MKO and SMY, and
                                factions within the SDP.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 10, 1993:</strong> Association for Better Nigeria (ABN), led by Arthur Nzeribe,
                                obtained an order from the Abuja High Court to prevent NEC from conducting the elections on
                                June 12. The ABN was allegedly funded by IBB.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 12, 1993:</strong> Abiola of the SDP party defeated National Republican
                                Convention’s Bashir Tofa. Although the winner was not announced, Abiola was said to have
                                garnered 8,341,309 votes while Tofa scored 5,952,087 votes.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 13, 1993:</strong> From post-election morning, announcements of results by NEC
                                began.</li>

                                Attorney-General of the Federation, Clement Akpamgbo, to cease further announcements of
                                results. ABN had returned to the Abuja court and got a ruling from Justice Dahiru Saleh,
                                declaring the June 12 elections illegal, and restrained NEC from releasing any results.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 18, 1993: </strong>Human rights group, Campaign for Democracy, led by Dr Beko
                                Ransome-Kuti, tender the full election results at a Lagos court, showing a 58.36% victory
                                for Abiola’s SDP against 41.64% for Tofa and the NRC.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 23, 1993: </strong>Nigeria’s military dictatorship, led by General Ibrahim
                                Babangida, annulled the June 12 presidential election and canceled plans to return the
                                nation to civilian rule.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 26, 1993:</strong> General Babangida addresses the nation on the reason for the
                                annulment. “It is true that the presidential election was generally seen to be free, fair
                                and peaceful. However, there was a huge array of electoral malpractice virtually in all
                                states of the federation before the actual voting began. About 2.1 billion naira was spent
                                by both presidential candidates. We have authenticated reports of electoral malpractice
                                against party agents, NEC officials and the electorate, who were manipulated through offer
                                and acceptance of money and other forms of inducements… “The conduct of the election, the
                                behavious of the candidates and post election responses continued to elicit signals which
                                the nation can only ignore at its peril. To proclaim and swear in a president who has
                                encouraged a campaign of divide and rule amongst our various ethnic groups would have been
                                detrimental to the survival of the third republic,” he had said.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>July 6, 1993:</strong>The National Defense and Security Council (NDSC) issued an
                                ultimatum to the SDP and NRC to either join an interim government or face another round of
                                elections</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>August 27, 1993:</strong> Babangida announced that he would hand over to an interim
                                civilian government. It was reportedly assumed that the military leader was devising ways to
                                continue staying in power.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>November 28, 1993:</strong> Britain, the United States and France condemned the
                                latest military takeover and threatened to toughen sanctions against Nigeria. General Sani
                                Abacha had taken power from interim President, Ernest Shonekan.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 23, 1994:</strong> M.K.O Abiola was arrested after he declared himself
                                President at a rally in Lagos. He was immediately declared wanted for treason and was
                                arrested on the orders of military President Sani Abacha.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>June 1996: </strong>Abiola’s second wife, Kudirat was assassinated in Lagos after
                                declaring public support for her husband.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>July 7, 1998:</strong> M.K.O Abiola died same day he was supposed to be released
                                from prison. An autopsy report conducted revealed that Abiola received insufficient medical
                                attention for his existing health conditions. Abacha’s Chief Security Officer, al-Mustapha
                                has alleged that Moshood Abiola was beaten to death. Al-Mustapha, who was detained by the
                                Nigerian government claims to have video and audiotapes showing how Abiola was beaten to
                                death.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, CFR (24 August 1937 – 7 July 1998) was a Nigerian Yoruba
                            businessman, publisher, politician and aristocrat of the Yoruba Egba clan. MKO Abiola ran for
                            the presidency in 1993, for which the election results were annulled by the preceding military
                            president Ibrahim Babangida because of allegations that they were corrupt and unfair.</p>
